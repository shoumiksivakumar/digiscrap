      <p class="description-text">You are the safest place my heart has ever known. From the very start, being with you felt natural like coming home to something I never knew I was missing. 
        Love found us when we least expected it, and now, I can't imagine a life where I don't get to love you every single day. Thank you for being my best friend and sticking by my side through everything. I genuinely don't think there's a mountain we can't climb together.
